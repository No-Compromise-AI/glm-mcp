# postmq-session-start — a SessionStart hook for Claude Code and Codex.
#
# Both clients run a SessionStart hook the same way: they hand it a JSON payload on stdin and put
# whatever it prints into the model's context before the first turn. This script reads nothing from
# that payload and needs no client-specific variable — it runs with its working directory set to the
# project root on both, so plain `git` is all it needs. Keep it that way: the moment it reaches for
# $CLAUDE_PROJECT_DIR or a Codex equivalent, it stops being one file.
#
# Prints the session protocol reminder and the drift signals that can be computed LOCALLY, from git,
# in well under a second. It deliberately makes no network call and no MCP call: a SessionStart hook
# runs before the agent does anything, and a slow or flaky one is worse than no hook at all.
#
# It prints exactly what it can see, and nothing it cannot. If you extend it, keep that property —
# a hook credited with a signal it does not actually print is worse than a hook without the signal,
# because everyone downstream believes the check happened.
#
# Portable to bash 3.2 (macOS ships it), no globstar, no mapfile, no associative arrays.
